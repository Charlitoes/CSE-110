Hi, I'm Charlie Trinh, I am a 3rd-year computer science major **with an interest in cybersecurity**.

Getting to know me: I enjoy listening to music and playing video games (lately I've been playing the new Final Fantasy VII game that came out recently). I also like to play instruments such as the piano and guitar whenever I have the spare time to. I am also a transfer student so getting to know more people has been pretty daunting so I hope to meet more people throughout my time at UCSD.

Throughout this term, I hope to learn
1. Working with a group rather than working solo ~~(Although knowing my introverted self it could pose as a challenge)~~
2. What it means to be a SWE
3. How I can apply this knowledge to improve my own skill
